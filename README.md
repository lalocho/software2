## Product Perspective

Prevent, Mitigate, and Recover (PMR) Insight Collective Knowledge System (PICK) is an interactive system that facilitates correlations between red team’s activities and blue team’s responses and generates graphical representation of events that took place during an adversarial assessment.

## Scope of Product

The Lethality, Survivability, and HSI Directorate (LSH) recognizes the complexity and the time it takes to analyze the applicable logs, observation notes, and other artifacts gathered from an adversarial assessment from the red, blue, and white teams and generate a report that presents the events that took place during the adversarial assessment.  They want a system that would aid their analysts in correlating red team’s activities to blue team’s responses and represent the events that took place during an adversarial assessment graphically.  

The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and LSH are collaborating to develop Prevent, Mitigate, and Recover (PMR) Insight Collective Knowledge System (PICK) that will provide the ability to correlate red team’s activities to blue team’s responses and graphically represent the events that took place during an adversarial assessment.
